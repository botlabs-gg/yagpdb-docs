# Soundboard

### Name

Give the sound a name. This name will be shown in the list to play later on. Avoid giving duplicated names for easier reference.

### Required role

Choose to require users to have a role in order to play this sound.

### Upload file

{% hint style="info" %}
Do **NOT** fill in the URL if you are going uploaded from local files, and vice versa.
{% endhint %}

You have two options to upload sounds:

* Upload with local files
* Specify a URL

#### Upload with local files

Click on _Choose file_ and __ select an audio file to upload. All types of sound files, including videos with sound tracks, are supported.

#### Specify a URL

You can also specify a sound URL instead of uploading one.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This has to be the direct link to the media file, and not a YouTube link. A direct link should end with`.mp3`(or other relevant audio/video type), such as [http://soundboard.panictank.net/AIRHORN.mp3](http://soundboard.panictank.net/AIRHORN.mp3).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Finish

Click on _Upload/Download_ after you are done with the previous steps. You should see a _Success_ notification when the upload is completed. Check the status of the sound under _Existing sounds_. __ Wait for several minutes, and press _Save_ again if the status does not show _Ready_.

## Playing sounds

You can check for an available list of sounds with the `-soundboard` command. Then, play it with the `-sb <sound name>` command. Make sure that YAGPDB has the right permissions (i.e. connect to  and speak in the voice channel).

## Deleting sounds

You can delete sounds from the control panel. Look for the desired sound name under _Existing sounds_ and press _Delete_ to remove it from the list.
